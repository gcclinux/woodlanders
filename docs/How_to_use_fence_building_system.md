Key Features:
Automatic piece selection - The system automatically chooses the right fence piece type for rectangular enclosures
Material validation - Can't place fences without sufficient materials
Visual feedback - Preview system shows what will be placed
Collision detection - Fences act as barriers that block movement
Multiplayer support - Fence building synchronizes across all clients

Building Tips:
Start with a corner and work your way around to create rectangular enclosures
The system works best for rectangular shapes but supports custom layouts
You can build with either wood or bamboo materials
Fences create collision boundaries, so plan your layouts carefully
Try it out by harvesting some trees or bamboo, then pressing B to enter building mode! 🎮

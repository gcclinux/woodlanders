How to Use the Fence Building System 🏗️
The fence building system has been successfully integrated into your game! Here's how to use it:

Step 1: Collect Fence Materials 📦
Harvest trees to get Wood Fence Materials
Harvest bamboo to get Bamboo Fence Materials
These materials will appear in your inventory automatically when you harvest
Step 2: Enter Fence Building Mode 🔧
Press the B key to toggle fence building mode on/off
When you enter building mode:
A grid overlay will appear showing valid placement positions
Your available fence materials count will be displayed
Building instructions will appear on screen
Normal player movement will be disabled (cursor-based interaction enabled)
Step 3: Build Fences 🚧
Left-click on any grid position to place a fence segment
Right-click on an existing fence segment to remove it
The system will:
Automatically select the correct fence piece type based on position
Deduct materials from your inventory when placing
Return materials to your inventory when removing
Show visual previews of what will be placed
Play sound effects for placement/removal
Step 4: Exit Building Mode ✅
Press B key again to exit building mode
The grid overlay will disappear
Normal gameplay controls will be restored
Key Features:
Automatic piece selection - The system automatically chooses the right fence piece type for rectangular enclosures
Material validation - Can't place fences without sufficient materials
Visual feedback - Preview system shows what will be placed
Collision detection - Fences act as barriers that block movement
Multiplayer support - Fence building synchronizes across all clients
World persistence - Your fences save with your world and persist between sessions
Building Tips:
Start with a corner and work your way around to create rectangular enclosures
The system works best for rectangular shapes but supports custom layouts
You can build with either wood or bamboo materials
Fences create collision boundaries, so plan your layouts carefully
Try it out by harvesting some trees or bamboo, then pressing B to enter building mode! 🎮

# Woodlanders - A 2D Multiplayer Adventure

## 🌐 [Play Woodlanders - Official Game Homepage](https://gcclinux.github.io/woodlanders/)

## 🎮 The AI-Driven Game Development Story

**Woodlanders** is an ambitious experiment in AI-assisted game development - a fully functional multiplayer 2D adventure game built entirely through conversational AI. This project demonstrates what's possible when human creativity meets AI capabilities: no manual coding, just natural language prompts, specifications, and iterative refinement.

### 🤖 AI Tools Powering This Project

This game was developed using a combination of cutting-edge AI tools, each contributing to different aspects of development:

- **Kiro IDE** (Primary) - The main development environment where most code generation, debugging, and feature implementation occurred through natural language conversations
- **Amazon Q** - AI assistant embedded in Kiro IDE and available as a VSCode extension, providing intelligent code suggestions and assistance
- **GitHub Copilot** - Used within Visual Studio Code IDE for the Woodlanders launcher, leveraging autocomplete and multiple dedicated LLMs
- **Microsoft Copilot & Google Gemini** - AI tools for generating and identifying imagery and object items on sprite sheets, helping create visual assets
- **Antigravity** - The powerful agentic AI coding assistant, using the fast GPT‑OSS model for rapid code generation and iteration or autonomous code generation.

### The Vision: Zero-Code Game Development

The goal was simple yet audacious: **build a complete, enjoyable multiplayer game in Java using only AI prompts and requests**. No direct code writing. No manual debugging. Just describing what we wanted, and letting Kiro AI bring it to life.
